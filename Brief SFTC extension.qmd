## Second fundamental theorem of calculus  
The second fundamental theorem of calculus, really an extension of the fundamental theorem where you let a bound be equal to $x$, says that if you differentiate the accumulation function, you get back to the original function. 
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\int_a^x f(t)dt\right]=f(x)
$$

This can be extended to any general function as the bounds of integration. The only caveat is that if we have a general function $u$ as the bound then we need to incorporate the chain rule. 

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\int_a^u f(t)dt\right]=f(u) \frac{du}{dx}
$$

## Example  
Find the derivative of $\displaystyle \int_{\pi/2}^{x^3} \cos(t) dt$

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(x) &= \int_{\pi/2}^{x^3} \cos(t) dt \\
F'(x) &= \frac{dF}{du}\frac{du}{dx} \\
  &= \frac{d}{du}[F(x)] \frac{du}{dx} \\
  &= \frac{d}{du} \left[\int_{\pi/2}^{x^3} \cos(t) dt \right] \frac{du}{dx} \\
  &= \frac{d}{du} \left[\int_{\pi/2}^u \cos(t)dt \right] \frac{du}{dx} \\
  &= (\cos(u))(3x^2) \\
  &= 3x^2 \cos(x^3)

\end{aligned}
