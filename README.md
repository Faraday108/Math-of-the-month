## Math of the Month
Within this repository, I'll be publishing various implementations of mathematics that has caught my attention with the intent of creating snippets of R code that illustrate aspects of the problem at hand. Within this I hope to expand my knowledge of R functionality, code interesting problems in R, and expand my domain knowledge of interesting mathematical concepts.
